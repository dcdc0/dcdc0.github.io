The code used to generate this website is available on my github page. It was written in markdown, built with jekyll, and hosted on github. Github setup First, you’ll need a github account. If you don’t have one, create one. Make sure to keep track of your username and email. Create a new repository. Name the repo username.github.io, replacing username with your username. Go to your github settings page and select the tab “SSH and GPG keys”. To be able to make “push” changes to this repository from your local machine (using the command line) you’ll need to generate an ssh key. If you’ve previously created an ssh key, you can use that one. Otherwise, run the command and click enter to select the defaults. ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &quot;your_email@example.com&quot; Run the commands (from your home directory). eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot; ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 Run the command `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub and copy the output. On github, add a new ssh key by clicking the button and pasting the output from the previous command. Now, working in a convenient directory of your choosing, run the command git clone https://github.com Enter that directory. Create a text file named index.html and give it the contents ‘Hello, World.’ You’ve now made a tiny website. To check it out, you’ll need to push the changes to github. To do this, we’ll first need to configure git to use your ssh key. To do so, run git remote set-url origin git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git Now, we need to tell git that you want to publish the work you’ve done. First, tell git to track the file with the command git add index.html then tell git that you’re ready to publish with the command git commit -am &quot;Initial commit.&quot; Now, you can push your changes with the command git push Now, go to username.github.io and see your first webpage." />
